A Github Pages template for academic websites configured to fit to my personal needs, this repository was forked (then detached) from [https://academicpages.github.io](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io). 

Original work was forked (then detached) by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou) from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), which is Â© 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License. See [LICENSE.md](LICENSE).

I think I've got things running smoothly and fixed some major bugs, but feel free to file issues or make pull requests if you want to improve the generic template / theme.
